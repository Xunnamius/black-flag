# Black Flag: Recipes and Examples

In this directory are a variety of recipes/examples for solving common CLI
design problems using [Black Flag][1], [Black Flag Extensions][2], and [Black
Flag Checks][3].

Several of these examples are inspired by, or just directly copied from,
[Yargs's own examples directory][4].

All examples are easy and simple to run:

1. Clone this repository
2. Change directory to the example you wish to run
3. Run `npm install`
4. Execute `npx cli-name` (replace "cli-name" with the name of the example's
   CLI)

The only exception is [yargs-examples][5], which consists of a single
`README.md` file containing code examples instead of an actual runnable program.
