// * These are relatively-simple "smoke" tests to ensure this software is
// * fetchable/installable/executable and exits cleanly when run within the
// * runtimes we support (e.g. the currently maintained node versions).
// *
// * Typically, these tests involve the use of deep mock fixtures and/or Docker
// * containers, and are built to run in GitHub Actions CI pipelines; some can
// * also be run locally.
