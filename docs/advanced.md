Since Black Flag is just a bunch of Yargs instances stacked on top of each other
wearing a trench coat, you can muck around with the internal Yargs instances
directly if you want.

For example, you can retrieve a mapping of all commands known to Black Flag and
their corresponding Yargs instances in the OS-specific order they were
encountered during auto-discovery:

```typescript
import { runCommand, $executionContext } from '@black-flag/core';

const argv = await runCommand('./commands');

// The next two function calls result in identical console output

console.log('commands:', argv[$executionContext].commands);

await runCommand('./commands', {
  configureExecutionEpilogue(_argv, { commands }) {
    console.log('commands:', commands);
  }
});
```

```javascript
commands: Map(6) {
  'myctl' => { programs: [Object], metadata: [Object] },
  'myctl init' => { programs: [Object], metadata: [Object] },
  'myctl remote' => { programs: [Object], metadata: [Object] },
  'myctl remote add' => { programs: [Object], metadata: [Object] },
  'myctl remote remove' => { programs: [Object], metadata: [Object] },
  'myctl remote show' => { programs: [Object], metadata: [Object] }
}
```

Each of these six commands is actually _three_ programs:

1. The **effector** (`programs.effector`) programs are responsible for
   second-pass arguments parsing and comprehensive validation, executing each
   command's actual [`handler`][11] function, generating specific help text
   during errors, and ensuring the final parse result bubbles up to the router
   program.

2. The **helper** (`programs.helper`) programs are responsible for generating
   generic help text as well as first-pass arguments parsing and initial
   validation. Said parse result is used as the `argv` third parameter passed to
   the [`builder`][11] functions of effectors.

3. The **router** (`programs.router`) programs are responsible for proxying
   control to other routers and to helpers, and for ensuring exceptions and
   final parse results bubble up to the root Black Flag execution context
   ([`PreExecutionContext::execute`][15]) for handling.

> See the [flow chart][58] below for a visual overview.

These three programs representing the root command are accessible from the
[`PreExecutionContext::rootPrograms`][15] property. They are also always the
first item in the `PreExecutionContext::commands` map.

```typescript
const preExecutionContext = configureProgram('./commands', {
  configureExecutionEpilogue(_argv, { commands }) {
    assert(preExecutionContext.rootPrograms === commands.get('myctl').programs);
    assert(
      preExecutionContext.rootPrograms ===
        commands.get(Array.from(commands.keys())[0])
    );
  }
});

await preExecutionContext.execute();
```

Effectors do the heavy lifting in that they actually execute their command's
[`handler`][11]. They are accessible via the [`programs.effector`][59] property
of each object in [`PreExecutionContext::commands`][15], and can be configured
as one might a typical Yargs instance.

Helpers are "clones" of their respective effectors and are accessible via the
[`programs.helper`][59] property of each object in
[`PreExecutionContext::commands`][15]. These instances have been reconfigured to
address [a couple bugs][4] in Yargs help text output by excluding aliases from
certain output lines and excluding positional arguments from certain others. A
side-effect of this is that only effectors recognize top-level positional
arguments, which isn't a problem Black Flag users have to worry about unless
they're dangerously tampering with these programs directly.

Routers are partially-configured just enough to proxy control to other routers
or to helpers and are accessible via the [`programs.router`][59] property of
each object in [`PreExecutionContext::commands`][15]. They cannot and _must not_
have any configured strictness or validation logic.

Therefore: if you want to tamper with the program responsible for running a
command's [`handler`][11], operate on the effector program. If you want to
tamper with a command's generic stdout help text, operate on the helper program.
If you want to tamper with validation and parsing, operate on both the helper
and effectors. If you want to tamper with the routing of control between
commands, operate on the router program.

See [the docs](api) for more details on Black Flag's internals.

 Motivation

Rather than chain singular Yargs instances together, the delegation of
responsibility between helper and effectors facilitates the double-parsing
necessary for [dynamic options][9] support. In implementing dynamic options,
Black Flag accurately parses the given arguments with the helper program on the
first pass and feeds the result to the [`builder`][11] function of the effector
on the second pass (via [`builder`'s new third parameter][9]).

In the same vein, hoisting routing responsibilities to the router program allows
Black Flag to make certain guarantees:

- An end user trying to invoke a parent command with no implementation, or a
  non-existent child command of such a parent, will cause help text to be
  printed and an exception to be thrown with default error exit code. E.g.:
  `myctl parent child1` and `myctl parent child2` work but we want
  `myctl parent` to show help text listing the available commands ("child1" and
  "child2") and exit with an error indicating the given command was not found.

- An end user trying to invoke a non-existent child of a strict pure child
  command will cause help text to be printed and an exception to be thrown with
  default error exit code. E.g.: we want `myctl exists noexist` and
  `myctl noexist` to show help text listing the available commands ("exists")
  and exit with an error indicating bad arguments.

- The right command gets to generate help and version text when triggered via
  arguments. To this end, passing `--help`/`--version` or equivalent arguments
  is effectively ignored by routers.

With vanilla Yargs's strict mode, attempting to meet these guarantees would
require disallowing any arguments unrecognized by the Yargs instances earlier in
the chain, even if the instances down-chain _do_ recognize said arguments. This
would break Black Flag's support for deep "chained" command hierarchies
entirely.

However, without vanilla Yargs's strict mode, attempting to meet these
guarantees would require allowing attempts to invoke non-existent child commands
without throwing an error or throwing the wrong/confusing error. Worse, it would
require a more rigid set of assumptions for the Yargs instances, meaning some
API features would be unnecessarily disabled. This would result in a deeply
flawed experience for developers and users.

Hence the need for a distinct _routing program_ which allows parent commands to
recursively chain/route control to child commands in your hierarchy even when
ancestor commands are not aware of the syntax accepted by their distant
descendantsâ€”while still properly throwing an error when the end user tries to
invoke a child command that does not exist or invoke a child command with
gibberish arguments.

 Generating Help Text

Effectors are essentially Yargs instances with a registered [default
command][45]. Unfortunately, when vanilla Yargs is asked to generate help text
for a default command that has aliases and/or top-level positional arguments,
you get the following:

![Vanilla Yargs parseAsync help text example][60]

This is not ideal output for several reasons. For one, the `"cmd"` alias of the
root command is being reported alongside `subcmd` as if it were a child command
when in actuality it's just an alias for the default command.

Worse, the complete command string (`'$0 root-positional'`) is also dumped into
output, potentially without any explanatory text. And even with explanatory text
for `root-positional`, what if the `subcmd` command has its own positional
argument also called `root-positional`?

```text
...
Commands:
  fake-name cmd root-positional     Root description                   [default]
  fake-name subcmd root-positional  Sub description
                                                  [aliases: sub, s] [deprecated]

Positionals:
  root-positional  Some description                                     [string]
...
```

It gets even worse. What if the description of `subcmd`'s `root-positional`
argument is different than the root command's version, and with entirely
different functionality? At that point the help text is actually _lying to the
user_, which could have drastic consequences when invoking powerful CLI commands
with permanent effects.

On the other hand, given the same configuration, Black Flag outputs the
following:

![Black Flag runProgram help text example][61]

> Note 1: in this example, `runProgram` is a function returned by
> [`makeRunner`][19].

> Note 2: in the above image, the first line under "Commands:" is the root
> command. In more recent versions of Black Flag, the root command is omitted
> from the list of sub-commands.
